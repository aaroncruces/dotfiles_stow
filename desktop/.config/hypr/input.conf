    # - Example above: Mild increase—slow movements (low velocity) have lower multipliers (less accel), faster ones ramp up.
    # - To increase acceleration more aggressively: custom 0.1 0.0 0.3 0.8 1.5 2.0 (test and adjust points for your preference).
    # - Leave points empty for a flat custom curve: custom  # Equivalent to no acceleration.
